# Python Assignment 3 – Functions and Math Module

Task 1: Calculate Factorial Using a Function
This program defines a function named `factorial` that takes a number as an argument and calculates its factorial using a loop.  
The function returns the factorial value, which is then printed by calling the function with a sample number.

Concepts Used:
- Functions
- for loop
- Return statement
- Variables

Task 2: Using the Math Module for Calculations
This program takes a number as input from the user and uses Python’s built-in `math` module to calculate:
- Square root of the number
- Natural logarithm (log base e)
- Sine of the number (in radians)

The calculated results are displayed on the screen.
 Concepts Used:
- math module
- math.sqrt()
- math.log()
- math.sin()
- input() function
